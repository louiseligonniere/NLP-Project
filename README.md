# NLP-Project

Code for the final project of the Natural Language Processing course (Ensae, 3A). 

### Project objective: 
Language identification for low-resource languages is a key issue for NLP models training. A recent paper published GlotLID-M, the first LID model that covers a wide range of low-resource language and is efficient and precise. Here, we follow previous work to evaluate the newest version of GlotLID-M on a recent dataset, build specifically for LID evaluation. We show that GlotLID exhibits good precision and recall and very low False Positive Rate, making it outperfom our baseline (OpenLID).
